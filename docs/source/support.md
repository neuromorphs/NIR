# Supported simulators and hardware

**NIR is currently supported by 7 simulators and 4 hardware platforms**, allowing users to seamlessly move between any of these platforms.
The 7 simulators include Lava-DL, Nengo, Norse, Rockpool, Sinabs, snnTorch, and Spyx.
The 4 hardware platforms include Intel Loihi (via Lava-DL), Xylo, Speck, and SpiNNaker2.

The table below shows the integration progress for the respective frameworks.
By "reading" a NIR graph, we mean converting it into a platform-specific representation.
"Writing" a NIR graph means converting a platform-specific representation into a NIR graph.

## Why are some platforms only reading or writing but not both?
Some platforms support both reading and writing, but in other cases it does not make sense to both read *and* write NIR graphs.
For example hardware platforms are meant as a *runtime* of NIR graphs, so it rarely makes sense to convert the hardware representation back into NIR.

## What about other simulators and hardware platforms?
NIR is a recent invention, and we are working hard to integrate it with as many simulators and hardware platforms as possible.
If you know of a simulator or hardware accelerator we should include, please get in touch with us here on GitHub.
