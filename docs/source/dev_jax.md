# JAX extensions

JAX is a popular deep learning framework that more and more of the NIR-supported libraries are built on.
For PyTorch, we have built the [`nirtorch` package](https://github.com/neuromorphs/nirtorch), but *no such package exists for JAX*.
If you're interested in developing such a package, please reach out to us!
