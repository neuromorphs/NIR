# NIR community events

NIR is meant to be practical and valuable from day one.
We are dedicated to interacting and paying back to the community both to (1) listen to the needs of the community and (2) to share our progress and learnings so that the entire community can benefit.
Below, you will find a list of events that we are hosting or participating in where you can meet us and learn more about NIR.
